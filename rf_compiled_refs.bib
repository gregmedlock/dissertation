  abstract = "Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on an unknown
              gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium isolated
              from human clinical specimens. This organism was indole negative,
              resistant to 20\% bile, produced acetic and a lesser amount of
              succinic acids as the major end products of glucose metabolism,
              and possessed a G+C content of approximately 43 mol\%.
              Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the
              unidentified bacterium was a member of the
              Cytophaga-Flavobacter-Bacteroides phylum of gram-negative
              bacteria and formed a close association (with an average sequence
              similarity of 93.6\%) with the second subcluster of the
              Porphyromonas cluster in the Bacteroides subgroup.
              Phylogenetically and phenotypically it resembled Bacteroides
              merdae; however, a 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence of
              approximately 5.5\% between the unknown bacterium and B. merdae,
              as well as distinguishable biochemical characteristics,
              demonstrate that the unknown bacterium is genotypically and
              phenotypically distinct and represents a previously unknown
              subline within the Porphyromonas phylogenetic cluster.
              Furthermore, a DNA-DNA reassociation value of 17.8\% between
              isolates WAL 12034(T) (the type strain of this novel taxon) and
              ATCC 43184(T) (B. merdae type strain) also documented the
              separateness of the unknown species and B. merdae. Based on the
              phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a new species,
              ``Bacteroides goldsteinii sp. nov,'' is proposed. The G+C content
              of the DNA is 43 mol\% for Bacteroides. The type strain of ``B.
              goldsteinii'' is WAL 12034(T) (= CCUG 48944(T) = ATCC

  abstract = "Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for
              analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established
              paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a
              promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical
              repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling
              techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little
              emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged
              constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure
              co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint,
              the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other
              microbes in the community. This is particularly important for
              predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes
              significant restrictions on the allowable community membership,
              composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the
              SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux
              distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement.
              SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear
              programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is
              independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage
              of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis.
              SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four E. coli
              double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut
              microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives
              from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and
              Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom
              is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to
              changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on
              the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an
              abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut
              microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step
              towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a
              microbial community in a given environment.",

              highly diverse and it is therefore challenging to assign specific
              properties to its individual members. Here, we have used a
              collection of murine bacterial strains and a modular design
              approach to create a minimal bacterial community that, once
              established in germ-free mice, provided colonization resistance
              against the human enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
              Typhimurium (S. Tm). Initially, a community of 12 strains, termed
              Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (Oligo-MM12), representing members of the
              major bacterial phyla in the murine gut, was selected. This
              community was stable over consecutive mouse generations and
              provided colonization resistance against S. Tm infection, albeit
              not to the degree of a conventional complex microbiota.
              Comparative (meta)genome analyses identified functions
              represented in a conventional microbiome but absent from the
              Oligo-MM12. By genome-informed design, we created an improved
              version of the Oligo-MM community harbouring three facultative
              anaerobic bacteria from the mouse intestinal bacterial collection
              (miBC) that provided conventional-like colonization resistance.
              In conclusion, we have established a highly versatile
              experimental system that showed efficacy in an enteric infection
              model. Thus, in combination with exhaustive bacterial strain
              collections and systems-based approaches, genome-guided design

              microbiota interact with each other, as well as with the host, is
              daunting. The altered Schaedler flora (ASF) is a model community
              of eight microorganisms that was developed by R.P. Orcutt and has
              been in use since the late 1970s. The eight microorganisms
              composing the ASF were all derived from mice, can be cultured in
              vitro, and are stably passed through multiple generations (at
              least 15 years or more by the authors) in gnotobiotic mice
              continually bred in isolator facilities. With the limitations
              associated with conventional, mono- or biassociated, and germfree
              mice, use of mice colonized with a consortium of known bacteria
              that naturally inhabit the murine gut offers a powerful system to
              investigate mechanisms governing host-microbiota relationships,

              The ASF community offers significant advantages to study
              homeostatic as well as disease-related interactions by taking
              advantage of a well-defined, limited community of microorganisms.
              For example, quantification and spatial distribution of
              individual members, microbial genetic manipulation, genomic-scale
              analysis, and identification of microorganism-specific host
              immune responses are all achievable using the ASF model. This

              propionate formation using genomic and metagenomic analysis of
              the human gut microbiota and by designing degenerate primer sets
              for the detection of diagnostic genes for these pathways.
              Degenerate primers for the acrylate pathway (detecting the lcdA
              gene, encoding lactoyl-CoA dehydratase) together with metagenomic
              mining revealed that this pathway is restricted to only a few
              human colonic species within the Lachnospiraceae and
              Negativicutes. The operation of this pathway for lactate
              utilisation in Coprococcus catus (Lachnospiraceae) was confirmed
              using stable isotope labelling. The propanediol pathway that
              processes deoxy sugars such as fucose and rhamnose was more
              abundant within the Lachnospiraceae (based on the pduP gene,
              which encodes propionaldehyde dehydrogenase), occurring in
              relatives of Ruminococcus obeum and in Roseburia inulinivorans.
              The dominant source of propionate from hexose sugars, however,
              was concluded to be the succinate pathway, as indicated by the
              widespread distribution of the mmdA gene that encodes
              methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase in the Bacteroidetes and in many
              Negativicutes. In general, the capacity to produce propionate or
              butyrate from hexose sugars resided in different species,
              although two species of Lachnospiraceae (C. catus and R.
              inulinivorans) are now known to be able to switch from butyrate
              to propionate production on different substrates. A better
              understanding of the microbial ecology of short-chain fatty acid

              Of the many challenges bacteria face in making a living, perhaps

              balance, and acquiring carbon and nitrogen to synthesize primary
              metabolites. The ability of bacteria to meet these challenges
              depends heavily on the rest of their community. Indeed, the most

              methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
              networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes
              with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA
              methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular
              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

              species, whose activities have tremendous impact on the plants,
              animals and humans they associate with. The ability to predict
              the structure of these complex communities is crucial to
              understanding and managing them. Here, we propose a simple,
              qualitative assembly rule that predicts community structure from
              the outcomes of competitions between small sets of species, and
              experimentally assess its predictive power using synthetic
              microbial communities composed of up to eight soil bacterial
              species. Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable
              community, whose composition was independent of the initial

              Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between

              define the signatures that were most important throughout

              carbohydrates decrease in abundance over time in the mouse cecum

              C. difficile physiology between the different time points

              how important the availability of amino acids and other nutrients
              is for the initial stages of C. difficile colonization and

              difficile in the gut will be important for developing new
              targeted bacterial therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile
              is a bacterial pathogen of global significance that is a major
              cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antibiotics deplete the
              indigenous gut microbiota and change the metabolic environment in
              the gut to one favoring C. difficile growth. Here we used
              metabolomics and transcriptomics to define the gut environment
              after antibiotics and during the initial stages of C. difficile
              colonization and infection. We show that amino acids, in
              particular, proline and branched-chain amino acids, and
              carbohydrates decrease in abundance over time and that C.
              difficile gene expression is consistent with their utilization by
              the bacterium in vivo. We employed an integrated approach to
              analyze the metabolome and transcriptome to identify associations
              between metabolites and transcripts. This highlighted the
              importance of key nutrients in the early stages of colonization,
              and the data provide a rationale for the development of therapies
              based on the use of bacteria that specifically compete for
              nutrients that are essential for C. difficile colonization and

              has combined both factors. The present studies were carried out
              with an immunologically manipulated mouse model of IBD. Mice

              expressing high levels of CD45RB (CD45RB(high) CD4+ T cells).
              These mice do not develop IBD in germfree conditions, implicating
              undefined intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of lesions. In
              controlled duplicate studies, the influence of a single murine

              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network
              structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of
              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many
              alternative network structures, all equally consistent with
              available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble.
              This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction

              rRNA analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from
              its presumptive identity. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361

              strains of Lactobacillus murinis and Lactobacillus animalis (both

              a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that

              519 falls into an unnamed genus containing [Bacteroides]

              into Clostridium cluster XIV of Collins et al. Morphologically,
              ASF 492 resembles members of this cluster, Roseburia cecicola,
              and Eubacterium plexicaudatum. The 16S rRNA sequence of ASF 492
              is identical to that of E. plexicaudatum. Since the type strain
              and other viable original isolates of E. plexicaudatum have been
              lost, strain ASF 492 is a candidate for a neotype strain. Strain

              phylogenetic tree but is not closely related to any organisms

              high-throughput pyrosequencing. In contrast to conventional mice

              highly susceptible to S. enterica induced colonization and
              enterocolitis. Colonization resistance was partially restored in
              LCM-animals by co-housing with conventional mice for 21 days

              complexity increased upon conventionalization and correlated with
              increased resistance to S. enterica infection. Comparative
              microbiota analysis of mice with varying degrees of colonization
              resistance allowed us to identify intestinal ecosystem
              characteristics associated with susceptibility to S. enterica
              infection. Moreover, this system enabled us to gain further
              insights into the general principles of gut ecosystem invasion by
              non-pathogenic, commensal bacteria. Mice harboring high commensal
              E. coli densities were more susceptible to S. enterica induced
              gut inflammation. Similarly, mice with high titers of
              Lactobacilli were more efficiently colonized by a commensal
              Lactobacillus reuteri(RR) strain after oral inoculation. Upon
              examination of 16S rRNA sequence data from 9 CON mice we found
              that closely related phylotypes generally display significantly
              correlated abundances (co-occurrence), more so than distantly

              related species can increase the chance of invasion of newly

              magnitude (strong to weak). Interaction outcomes are
              context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a
              function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context
              dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is
              poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify
              variation in species interaction outcomes (competition,
              mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to
              our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did
              not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was
              most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least
              likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both
              the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most
              along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of
              the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of
              context dependency across these context types was not consistent
              among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly,
              study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context
              dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single
              most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction
              (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires
              that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain
              orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired
              amplification. The process of designing specific primers
              typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking
              regions of interest are generated either manually or using
              software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate
              nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine
              the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process
              as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets,
              such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer
              orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers.
              The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a
              time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when
              the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although
              the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target
              detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as
              BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily
              return complete match information over the entire primer range.
              RESULTS: We present a new software tool called Primer-BLAST to
              alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers.
              This tool combines BLAST with a global alignment algorithm to
              ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to
              detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to
              primers. Primer-BLAST allows users to design new target-specific
              primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of
              pre-existing primers. Primer-BLAST also supports placing primers
              based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) sites in primers. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a
              robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool
              that designs target-specific PCR primers. Primer-BLAST offers
              flexible options to adjust the specificity threshold and other
              primer properties. This tool is publicly available at

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The human intestine is colonized with trillions of
              microorganisms important to health and disease. There has been an
              intensive effort to catalog the species and genetic content of
              this microbial ecosystem. However, little is known of the
              ecological interactions between these microbes, a prerequisite to
              understanding the dynamics and stability of this host-associated
              microbial community. Here we perform a systematic investigation
              of public goods-based syntrophic interactions among the abundant
              human gut bacteria, the Bacteroidales. RESULTS: We find evidence
              for a rich interaction network based on the breakdown and use of
              polysaccharides. Species that utilize a particular polysaccharide
              (producers) liberate polysaccharide breakdown products (PBPs)
              that are consumed by other species unable to grow on the
              polysaccharide alone (recipients). Cross-species gene addition
              experiments demonstrate that recipients can grow on a
              polysaccharide if the producer-derived glycoside hydrolase,
              responsible for PBP generation, is provided. These
              producer-derived glycoside hydrolases are public goods
              transported extracellularly in outer membrane vesicles allowing
              for the creation of PBP and concomitant recipient growth
              spatially distant from the producer. Recipients can exploit these
              ecological interactions and conditionally outgrow producers.
              Finally, we show that these public goods-based interactions occur
              among Bacteroidales species coresident within a natural human

              in an effective, reproducible, and high-throughput approach that
              allows the study of general population samples from

  abstract = "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of
              hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk
              factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior
              exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial
              community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple
              antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility,
              many leading to distinct community structures stemming from
              variation in bacterial targets of action. These community
              structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile.
              Therefore, we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its
              physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments.
              Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated that C. difficile
              highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three
              antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore
              formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the
              antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C.
              difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient
              concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the
              bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C.
              difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This
              revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways
              for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C.
              difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model
              with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm
              integrating network architecture. This platform identified
              nutrients that C. difficile used preferentially between
              pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass
              spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the
              hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches
              across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for
              nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland
              fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans. IMPORTANCE
              Infection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an
              inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life threatening
              and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection.
              Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated
              with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut
              microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In
              this study, we demonstrated that C. difficile altered
              pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from
              separate classes and exploited different nutrient sources across
              these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also
              provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens
              during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile
              colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of
              bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could
              explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal
              microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment
              for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the
              identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that
              prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization, including pre- and
              probiotic therapies.",

              culture model of the cecal flora to investigate the possibility
              that competition for nutrients is one mechanism for this
              antagonism. The medium for the CF cultures consisted of
              homogenates of fecal pellets from germfree mice. Carbohydrate
              analysis showed that mouse flora depleted 74 to 99.8\% of the
              various carbohydrates from this environment-simulating medium.
              When inoculated into filtrates made from CF cultures of mouse
              flora, C. difficile multiplied slower than the dilution rate of
              the CF cultures unless glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or
              N-acetylneuraminic acid was added. C. difficile did not

              service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and
              completeness of the produced annotations. We summarize our
              attempts to address these issues and discuss plans for
              incrementally enhancing the service. CONCLUSION: By providing
              accurate, rapid annotation freely to the community we have
              created an important community resource. The service has now been
              utilized by over 120 external users annotating over 350 distinct

              reference and test spectra in a top-down fashion, sequentially
              subdividing the initial larger segments, as required, to improve
              the local spectral alignment. We also describe a general

              functionally important group of bacteria. Human colonic butyrate
              producers are Gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically
              diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to Eubacterium
              rectale/Roseburia spp. and to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Five
              different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the

              cases butyryl-CoA : acetate CoA-transferase, rather than butyrate

              Mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut Clostridium

              under anaerobic conditions in the absence of electron acceptors.
              The yields on these substrates exhibited significant differences
              when measured in carbon-limited chemostats at similar growth
              rates and compared in terms of grams (dry weight) of cells
              produced per mole of hexose utilized. Maltohexaose was the most
              efficiently utilized substrate, and galactose was the least
              efficiently utilized under these conditions. All these sugars
              were known to be metabolized to glucose 6-phosphate and produced
              the same pattern of fermentation products. The differences in
              growth yields were ascribed to differences in energy costs for
              transport and phosphorylation of these sugars. A formalized
              treatment of these factors in determining growth yields was
              established and used to obtain values for the cost of transport

              stoichiometry was found to be 1.1 to 1.8 H+ per lactose,
              equivalent to approximately 0.5 ATP used per lactose transported.
              The cost of transporting maltose via a binding-protein-dependent
              mechanism was considerably higher, being over 1 to 1.2 ATP per
              maltose or maltodextrin transported. The formalized treatment

              yield data were consistent with the production of 2.8 to 3.2 ATP

              increasingly being used to carry out a specific biochemical
              function in lieu of engineering a single microbe to do the same
              task. However, knowing how different species' metabolisms will
              integrate to reach a desired outcome is a difficult problem that
              has been studied in great detail using steady-state models.
              However, many biotechnological processes, as well as natural
              habitats, represent a more dynamic system. Examining how
              individual species use resources in their growth medium or
              environment (exometabolomics) over time in batch culture
              conditions can provide rich phenotypic data that encompasses
              regulation and transporters, creating an opportunity to integrate
              the data into a predictive model of resource use by a mixed
              community. RESULTS: Here we use exometabolomic profiling to
              examine the time-varying substrate depletion from a mixture of 19
              amino acids and glucose by two Pseudomonas and one Bacillus
              species isolated from ground water. Contrary to studies in model
              organisms, we found surprisingly few correlations between
              resource preferences and maximal growth rate or biomass
              composition. We then modeled patterns of substrate depletion, and
              used these models to examine if substrate usage preferences and
              substrate depletion kinetics of individual isolates can be used
              to predict the metabolism of a co-culture of the isolates. We
              found that most of the substrates fit the model predictions,
              except for glucose and histidine, which were depleted more slowly
              than predicted, and proline, glycine, glutamate, lysine and
              arginine, which were all consumed significantly faster.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a significant portion of a
              model community's overall metabolism can be predicted based on
              the metabolism of the individuals. Based on the nature of our
              model, the resources that significantly deviate from the
              prediction highlight potential metabolic pathways affected by
              species-species interactions, which when further studied can

              specifically detect as few as 10 copies of each target. Total
              numbers of the ASF strains were determined in the different
              regions of the GI tracts of three C.B-17 SCID mice. Individual

              five-carbon platform chemical that can be used for the synthesis
              of polymers and other chemicals of industrial interest. Enzymatic
              conversion of L-lysine to 5AVA has been achieved by employing
              lysine 2-monooxygenase encoded by the davB gene and
              5-aminovaleramidase encoded by the davA gene. Additionally, a
              recombinant Escherichia coli strain expressing the davB and davA
              genes has been developed for bioconversion of L-lysine to 5AVA.
              To use glucose and xylose derived from lignocellulosic biomass as
              substrates, rather than L-lysine as a substrate, we previously
              examined direct fermentative production of 5AVA from glucose by
              metabolically engineered E. coli strains. However, the yield and
              productivity of 5AVA achieved by recombinant E. coli strains
              remain very low. Thus, Corynebacterium glutamicum, a highly
              efficient L-lysine producing microorganism, should be useful in
              the development of direct fermentative production of 5AVA using
              L-lysine as a precursor for 5AVA. Here, we report the development
              of metabolically engineered C. glutamicum strains for enhanced
              fermentative production of 5AVA from glucose. RESULTS: Various
              expression vectors containing different promoters and origins of
              replication were examined for optimal expression of Pseudomonas
              putida davB and davA genes encoding lysine 2-monooxygenase and
              delta-aminovaleramidase, respectively. Among them, expression of
              the C. glutamicum codon-optimized davA gene fused with His6-Tag
              at its N-Terminal and the davB gene as an operon under a strong
              synthetic H36 promoter (plasmid p36davAB3) in C. glutamicum
              enabled the most efficient production of 5AVA. Flask culture and
              fed-batch culture of this strain produced 6.9 and 19.7 g/L
              (together with 11.9 g/L glutaric acid as major byproduct) of
              5AVA, respectively. Homology modeling suggested that endogenous
              gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase encoded by the gabT gene
              might be responsible for the conversion of 5AVA to glutaric acid
              in recombinant C. glutamicum. Fed-batch culture of a C.
              glutamicum gabT mutant-harboring p36davAB3 produced 33.1 g/L 5AVA
              with much reduced (2.0 g/L) production of glutaric acid.
              CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium glutamicum was successfully
              engineered to produce 5AVA from glucose by optimizing the
              expression of two key enzymes, lysine 2-monooxygenase and
              delta-aminovaleramidase. In addition, production of glutaric
              acid, a major byproduct, was significantly reduced by employing
              C. glutamicum gabT mutant as a host strain. The metabolically
