  title    = "How accurate is automated gap filling of metabolic models?",
  author   = "Karp, Peter D and Weaver, Daniel and Latendresse, Mario",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Reaction gap filling is a computational technique for
              proposing the addition of reactions to genome-scale metabolic
              models to permit those models to run correctly. Gap filling
              completes what are otherwise incomplete models that lack fully
              connected metabolic networks. The models are incomplete because
              they are derived from annotated genomes in which not all enzymes
              have been identified. Here we compare the results of applying an
              automated likelihood-based gap filler within the Pathway Tools
              software with the results of manually gap filling the same
              metabolic model. Both gap-filling exercises were applied to the
              same genome-derived qualitative metabolic reconstruction for
              Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum JCM 1217, and to the same
              modeling conditions - anaerobic growth under four nutrients
              producing 53 biomass metabolites. RESULTS: The solution computed
              by the gap-filling program GenDev contained 12 reactions, but
              closer examination showed that solution was not minimal; two of
              the twelve reactions can be removed to yield a set of ten
              reactions that enable model growth. The manually curated solution
              contained 13 reactions, eight of which were shared with the
              12-reaction computed solution. Thus, GenDev achieved recall of
              61.5\% and precision of 66.6\%. These results suggest that
              although computational gap fillers are populating metabolic
              models with significant numbers of correct reactions,
              automatically gap-filled metabolic models also contain
              significant numbers of incorrect reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              conclusion is that manual curation of gap-filler results is
              needed to obtain high-accuracy models. Many of the differences
              between the manual and automatic solutions resulted from using
              expert biological knowledge to direct the choice of reactions
              within the curated solution, such as reactions specific to the
              anaerobic lifestyle of B. longum.",

              metabolic model predictions",
  author   = "Robaina-Est{\'e}vez, Semid{\'a}n and Nikoloski, Zoran",
  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in
              reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally,
              our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into
              account for rendering the context-specific metabolic model

              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network
              structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of
              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many

              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

  abstract = "Constraint-based models of metabolism are a widely used framework
              for predicting flux distributions in genome-scale biochemical
              networks. The number of published methods for integration of
              transcriptomic data into constraint-based models has been rapidly
              increasing. So far the predictive capability of these methods has
              not been critically evaluated and compared. This work presents a
              survey of recently published methods that use transcript levels
              to try to improve metabolic flux predictions either by generating
              flux distributions or by creating context-specific models. A
              subset of these methods is then systematically evaluated using
              published data from three different case studies in E. coli and
              S. cerevisiae. The flux predictions made by different methods
              using transcriptomic data are compared against experimentally
              determined extracellular and intracellular fluxes (from
              13C-labeling data). The sensitivity of the results to
              method-specific parameters is also evaluated, as well as their
              robustness to noise in the data. The results show that none of
              the methods outperforms the others for all cases. Also, it is
              observed that for many conditions, the predictions obtained by
              simple flux balance analysis using growth maximization and
              parsimony criteria are as good or better than those obtained
              using methods that incorporate transcriptomic data. We further
              discuss the differences in the mathematical formulation of the

  abstract = "The large size of metabolic networks entails an overwhelming
              multiplicity in the possible steady-state flux distributions that
              are compatible with stoichiometric constraints. This space of
              possibilities is largest in the frequent situation where the
              nutrients available to the cells are unknown. These two factors:
              network size and lack of knowledge of nutrient availability,
              challenge the identification of the actual metabolic state of
              living cells among the myriad possibilities. Here we address this
              challenge by developing a method that integrates gene-expression
              measurements with genome-scale models of metabolism as a means of
              inferring metabolic states. Our method explores the space of
              alternative flux distributions that maximize the agreement
              between gene expression and metabolic fluxes, and thereby
              identifies reactions that are likely to be active in the culture
              from which the gene-expression measurements were taken. These
              active reactions are used to build environment-specific metabolic
              models and to predict actual metabolic states. We applied our
              method to model the metabolic states of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              growing in rich media supplemented with either glucose or ethanol
              as the main energy source. The resulting models comprise about
              50\% of the reactions in the original model, and predict
              environment-specific essential genes with high sensitivity. By
              minimizing the sum of fluxes while forcing our predicted active
              reactions to carry flux, we predicted the metabolic states of
              these yeast cultures that are in large agreement with what is
              known about yeast physiology. Most notably, our method predicts
              the Crabtree effect in yeast cells growing in excess glucose, a
              long-known phenomenon that could not have been predicted by
              traditional constraint-based modeling approaches. Our method is
              of immediate practical relevance for medical and industrial
              applications, such as the identification of novel drug targets,
              and the development of biotechnological processes that use

              clear - we simply wish to identify it and the true parameters

              now been constructed and are being used for model driven
              research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is
              the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same
              maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through
              different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects
              that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range
              of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP)
              and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based
              strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability
              that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as
              suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for
              growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate

              flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental
              conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the
              impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout
              conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed
              that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant

              optima is high. The underlying biological significance and

              through the identification of redundancies in the network
              (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions.
