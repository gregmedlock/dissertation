  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been an increasing problem
              with Staphylococcus aureus strains that are resistant to
              treatment with existing antibiotics. An important starting point
              for the development of new antimicrobial drugs is the
              identification of ``essential'' genes that are important for
              bacterial survival and growth. RESULTS: We have developed a
              robust microarray and PCR-based method, Transposon-Mediated
              Differential Hybridisation (TMDH), that uses novel bioinformatics
              to identify transposon inserts in genome-wide libraries.
              Following a microarray-based screen, genes lacking transposon
              inserts are re-tested using a PCR and sequencing-based approach.
              We carried out a TMDH analysis of the S. aureus genome using a
              large random mariner transposon library of around a million
              mutants, and identified a total of 351 S. aureus genes important
              for survival and growth in culture. A comparison with the
              essential gene list experimentally derived for Bacillus subtilis
              highlighted interesting differences in both pathways and
              individual genes. CONCLUSION: We have determined the first
              comprehensive list of S. aureus essential genes. This should act
              as a useful starting point for the identification of potential
              targets for novel antimicrobial compounds. The TMDH methodology
              we have developed is generic and could be applied to identify
              essential genes in other bacterial pathogens.",

              methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
              networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes
              with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA
              methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular
              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

              proven difficult to execute in an untargeted and generalizable
              manner. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has made
              it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites.
              However, matching metabolites to their spectral features
              continues to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected
              information remains uninterpreted and that new metabolites are
              seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges require
              new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in
              curated biochemistry databases. DESCRIPTION: Here we present
              Metabolic In silico Network Expansions (MINEs), an extension of
              known metabolite databases to include molecules that have not
              been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites
              and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called
              the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE)
              and expert-curated reaction rules based on the Enzyme Commission
              classification system to propose the novel chemical structures
              and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the
              Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database,
              the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds, of which 93\% are not
              present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds
              have on average higher structural similarity to natural products
              than compounds from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to
              propose annotations for 98.6\% of a set of 667 MassBank spectra,
              14\% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem while
              returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs.
              1715 median candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate
              mass data enabled the identity of an unknown peak to be
              confidently predicted. CONCLUSIONS: MINE databases are freely
              accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at
              http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov and developer-friendly APIs.
              MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared to
              general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant
              synthetic compounds. Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on
              previous in silico generated compound databases that focus on
              human metabolism. We are actively developing the database; future
              versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules
              for spontaneous chemical reactions and more advanced filtering
              and prioritization of candidate structures. Graphical

              the substrate was 1.3 micromol min(-1) (mg of protein)(-1), which
              was 4\% of that with L-serine as substrate. Reduction of SHMT
              activity in vivo was obtained by placing the essential glyA gene
              in the chromosome under the control of P(tac), making glyA
              expression isopropylthiogalactopyranoside dependent. In this way,
              the SHMT activity in an L-threonine producer was reduced to 8\%
              of the initial activity, which led to a 41\% reduction in
              glycine, while L-threonine was simultaneously increased by 49\%.
              The intracellular availability of L-threonine to aldole cleavage
              was also reduced by overexpressing the L-threonine exporter thrE.
              In C. glutamicum DR-17, which overexpresses thrE, accumulation of
              67 mM instead of 49 mM L-threonine was obtained. This shows that
              the potential for amino acid formation can be considerably
              improved by reducing its intracellular degradation and increasing
              its export.",

              repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that
              occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and
              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network
              structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of
              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many
              alternative network structures, all equally consistent with
              available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble.
              This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction
              methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance
              Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting
              growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be
              included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential
              genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential
              genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some
              metabolic subsystems contributed disproportionately to the set of
              predicted essential reactions in a way that was unique to each
              Streptococcus species, leading to species-specific outcomes from
              small molecule interactions. Through our analyses of P.
              aeruginosa and six Streptococci, we show that ensembles increase
              the quality of predictions without drastically increasing
              reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical
              for applications which require predictions for many non-model

              of molecular evolution. In contrast, relatively little is known
              about the long-term evolution of species' phenotypic and genetic
              properties. This represents an important gap in our understanding
              of evolution, as exactly these proprieties play key roles in
              natural selection and adaptation to diverse environments. Here we
              perform a comparative analysis of bacterial growth and gene
              deletion phenotypes using hundreds of genome-scale metabolic
              models. Overall, bacterial phenotypic evolution can be described
              by a two-stage process with a rapid initial phenotypic
              diversification followed by a slow long-term exponential
              divergence. The observed average divergence trend, with
              approximately similar fractions of phenotypic properties changing
              per unit time, continues for billions of years. We experimentally
              confirm the predicted divergence trend using the phenotypic
              profiles of 40 diverse bacterial species across more than 60
              growth conditions. Our analysis suggests that, at long
              evolutionary distances, gene essentiality is significantly more
              conserved than the ability to utilize different nutrients, while
              synthetic lethality is significantly less conserved. We also find
              that although a rapid phenotypic evolution is sometimes observed
              within the same species, a transition from high to low phenotypic
              similarity occurs primarily at the genus level.",

              public data. Researchers can assemble their raw sequence reads
              and annotate the contigs using RASTtk. PATRIC also provides
              services for RNA-Seq, variation, model reconstruction and
              differential expression analysis, all delivered through an
              updated private workspace. Private data can be compared by
              'virtual integration' to any of PATRIC's public data. The number
              of genomes available for comparison in PATRIC has expanded to
              over 80 000, with a special emphasis on genomes with
              antimicrobial resistance data. PATRIC uses this data to improve
              both subsystem annotation and k-mer classification, and tags new
              genomes as having signatures that indicate susceptibility or
              resistance to specific antibiotics.",

  abstract  = "After hundreds of generations of adaptive evolution at
               exponential growth, Escherichia coli grows as predicted using
               flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome‐scale metabolic models
               (GEMs). However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway
               usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein
               expression in the wild‐type and evolved strains. Here, we report
               that >98\% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions
               are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover,
               when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the
               evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth
               predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal
               growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage
               limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are
               overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory
               processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal
               growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the
               downregulation of known regulons and stringent response
               suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from
               wild‐type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed
               growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM‐computed
               optimal growth states. \#\#\# Synopsis When prokaryotes are
               maintained at early‐ to mid‐log phase growth through serial
               passaging for hundreds of generations, the strains improve
               fitness and evolve a higher growth rate ([Lenski and Travisano,
               1994][1]; [Ibarra et al , 2002][2]). This increased growth rate
               is the result of the appearance of a few causal mutations
               ([Herring et al , 2006][3]; [Conrad et al , 2009][4]). In
               Escherichia coli , these altered growth phenotypes are
               consistent with predictions from genome‐scale models of
               metabolism (GEMs) ([Ibarra et al , 2002][2]; [Fong and Palsson,
               2004][5]). However, it is still not known (1) whether absolute
               gene and protein expression levels and expression changes are
               consistent with optimal growth predictions from in silico GEMs
               or (2) whether measured expression changes can be linked to
               physiological changes that are based on known mechanisms or
               pathways. In this study, we begin to address these questions
               using constraint‐based modeling of E. coli K‐12 metabolism
               ([Feist and Palsson, 2008][6]) to analyze omic data that
               document the expression changes in E. coli under adaptive
               evolution in three different growth conditions. Mapping
               high‐throughput data to a network can be useful for
               interpretation. However, it does not account for upstream and
               downstream effects of gene and protein expression changes. The
               analysis of data in the context of GEMs can suggest if predicted
               activity is consistent with the data. For this work, we used a
               variant of flux balance analysis (FBA), called Parsimonious
               enzyme usage FBA (pFBA) ([Figure 1][7]), to classify all genes
               according to whether they are used in the optimal growth
               solutions. Results from these models were compared with the data
               to assess whether the data were consistent with genes and
               proteins within the predicted optimal solutions, and whether the
               expression changes were consistent with measured physiology.
               Through this analysis, we find that the data provide a high
               coverage of genes that contribute to the optimal growth
               solutions ([Figure 1B][7]). In fact, the union of the proteomic
               and transcriptomic data for non‐essential genes provides support
               for 97.7\% of all non‐essential gene‐associated reactions within
               the optimal growth predictions. Thus, the spectrum of expressed
               genes and proteins is consistent with the pathway utilization
               that is predicted for these optimal growth phenotypes.
               Laboratory‐evolved strains attain a higher growth rate. This
               higher growth rate is usually associated with an increased
               substrate uptake rate ([Ibarra et al , 2002][2]; [Fong et al ,
               2005][8]) and in some cases more efficient metabolism ([Ibarra
               et al , 2002][2]). Both of these properties are also witnessed
               in the strains studied here. It has been reported that in most
               cases, evolved strain growth phenotype is consistent with GEM
               predictions ([Ibarra et al , 2002][2]; [Teusink et al ,
               2009][9]). Here, we evaluate whether the laboratory‐evolved
               strains adjust the gene and protein expression levels in
               accordance with pathway usage in the optimal growth predictions.
               Essential and non‐essential genes and proteins within the
               optimal growth solutions are significantly upregulated ([Figure
               1B][7]). This suggests that these proteins may be acting as
               bottlenecks that are relieved through the adaptive process,
               thereby allowing for a higher substrate uptake rate and growth
               rate. However, genes and proteins associated with reactions that
               cannot carry a flux in the given growth conditions are
               downregulated in the evolved strains ([Figure 1B][7]).
               Furthermore, there is downregulation of genes associated with
               less efficient pathways ([Figure 5C][10]). Thus, the omic data
               support the emergence of the predicted optimal growth states,
               consistent with the increased substrate uptake upstream and the
               increased biomass production downstream of these internal
               pathways. Regulatory mechanisms, both known and unknown, are
               responsible for the changes seen here. Across all data sets,
               several metabolic regulons are significantly downregulated.
               However, no known regulons were enriched among upregulated genes
               or proteins for all but one data set. Aside from just regulating
               the metabolic pathways directly, these mechanisms lead to
               additional physiological changes. For example, in the minimal
               media growth conditions used here, the stringent response
               normally represses growth while upregulating amino‐acid
               biosynthetic processes. However, evolved strain gene expression
               shows a suppression of the stringent response, as evolved strain
               gene expression shows either no expression change or changes
               opposite to the normal stringent response. The implications of
               this work are as follows: (1) genome‐scale gene and protein
               expression data are consistent with FBA computed optimal growth
               states, and evolved strains reinforce these optimal states; (2)
               genome‐scale models will have an important function bridging the
               gap between genotype and phenotype; and (3) the development of
               additional genome‐scale models of other growth‐related processes
               such as transcription and translation ([Thiele et al ,
               2009][11]) will have an important function in elucidating the
               mechanisms that contribute the most to altered phenotypes
               ([Lewis et al , 2009a][12]). In addition, reconstruction of the
               transcriptional regulation network will aid in identifying the
               control of expression changes seen in the other systems. Mol
