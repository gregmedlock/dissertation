              open-label clinical trials. Objective: To determine the efficacy
              and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI. Design:
              Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.
              (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494). Setting: Two academic medical
              centers. Patients: 46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of
              CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most
              recent acute episode. Intervention: Fecal microbiota
              transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own
              stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy. Measurements: The
              primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for
              further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data
              were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse
              events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for
              6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on
              patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.
              Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients
              (90.9\%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared
              with 15 of 24 (62.5\%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042).
              Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6
              of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI
              after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent
              donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored
              gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble
              that of healthy donors. Limitation: The study included only
              patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those who
              were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older. Conclusion:
              Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more
              efficacious than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI

              repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that
              occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and
              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network
              structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of
              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many
              alternative network structures, all equally consistent with
              available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble.
              This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction
              methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance
              Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting
              growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be
              included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential
              genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential
              genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some
              metabolic subsystems contributed disproportionately to the set of
              predicted essential reactions in a way that was unique to each
              Streptococcus species, leading to species-specific outcomes from
              small molecule interactions. Through our analyses of P.
              aeruginosa and six Streptococci, we show that ensembles increase
              the quality of predictions without drastically increasing
              reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical
              for applications which require predictions for many non-model
              organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are

              of eight microorganisms that was developed by R.P. Orcutt and has
              been in use since the late 1970s. The eight microorganisms
              composing the ASF were all derived from mice, can be cultured in
              vitro, and are stably passed through multiple generations (at
              least 15 years or more by the authors) in gnotobiotic mice
              continually bred in isolator facilities. With the limitations
              associated with conventional, mono- or biassociated, and germfree
              mice, use of mice colonized with a consortium of known bacteria
              that naturally inhabit the murine gut offers a powerful system to

              The ASF community offers significant advantages to study
              homeostatic as well as disease-related interactions by taking
              advantage of a well-defined, limited community of microorganisms.
              For example, quantification and spatial distribution of
              individual members, microbial genetic manipulation, genomic-scale
              analysis, and identification of microorganism-specific host
              immune responses are all achievable using the ASF model. This

              the ASF, including descriptions of its continued use in

              changed clinicians' ideas about microbes in human health and
              disease. Perhaps the most radical change is the realization that
              most of the microbes that inhabit our body supply crucial
              ecosystem services that benefit the entire host-microbe system.
              These services include the production of important resources,
              bioconversion of nutrients, and protection against pathogenic

              functions or the introduction of maladaptive functions by
              invading microbes. This review will show how an understanding of
              the dynamics and function of the indigenous microbiota has
              altered our view of microbes in maintaining homeostasis and

  author   = "Robaina-Est{\'e}vez, Semid{\'a}n and Nikoloski, Zoran",
  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in
              reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally,
              our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into
              account for rendering the context-specific metabolic model

              suggested to be a pathobiont, a commensal that plays a role in
              disease. In order to gain insights into its lifestyle, we
              analyzed the genome and transcriptome of M. schaedleri ASF 457
              and performed physiological experiments to test traits predicted
              by its genome. Although described as a mucus inhabitant, M.
              schaedleri has limited capacity for degrading host-derived
              mucosal glycans and other complex polysaccharides. Additionally,
              M. schaedleri reduces nitrate and expresses systems for
              scavenging oxygen and reactive oxygen species in vivo, which may
              account for its localization close to the mucosal tissue and
              expansion during inflammation. Also of note, M. schaedleri
              harbors a type VI secretion system and putative effector proteins
              and can modify gene expression in mucosal tissue, suggesting
              intimate interactions with its host and a possible role in
              inflammation. The M. schaedleri genome has been shaped by
              extensive horizontal gene transfer, primarily from intestinal
              Epsilon- and Deltaproteobacteria, indicating that horizontal gene
              transfer has played a key role in defining its niche in the gut

              been associated with intestinal inflammation, but it remains
              unclear whether inflammation-associated bacteria are commensal or
              detrimental to their host. Here, we studied the lifestyle of the
              gut bacterium Mucispirillum schaedleri, which is associated with
              inflammation in widely used mouse models. We found that M.
              schaedleri has specialized systems to handle oxidative stress
              during inflammation. Additionally, it expresses secretion systems
              and effector proteins and can modify the mucosal gene expression
              of its host. This suggests that M. schaedleri undergoes intimate
              interactions with its host and may play a role in inflammation.
