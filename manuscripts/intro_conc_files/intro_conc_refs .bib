  abstract = "Understanding microbial ecosystems means unlocking the path
              toward a deeper knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of life.
              Engineered microbial communities are also extremely relevant to
              tackling some of today's grand societal challenges. Advanced
              meta-omics experimental techniques provide crucial insights into
              microbial communities, but have been so far mostly used for
              descriptive, exploratory approaches to answer the initial 'who is
              there?' QUESTION: An ecosystem is a complex network of dynamic
              spatio-temporal interactions among organisms as well as between
              organisms and the environment. Mathematical models with their
              abstraction capability are essential to capture the underlying
              phenomena and connect the different scales at which these systems
              act. Differential equation models and constraint-based
              stoichiometric models are deterministic approaches that can
              successfully provide a macroscopic description of the outcome
              from microscopic behaviors. In this mini-review, we present
              classical and recent applications of these modeling methods and
              illustrate the potential of their integration. Indeed, approaches
              that can capture multiple scales are needed in order to
              understand emergent patterns in ecosystems and their dynamics
              regulated by different spatio-temporal phenomena. We finally
              discuss promising examples of methods proposing the integration
              of differential equations with constraint-based stoichiometric
              models and argue that more work is needed in this direction.",

              clearance and by promoting intestinal and systemic inflammation.

  abstract = "Pairwise models are commonly used to describe many-species

              microbial species engaging in commonly-found chemical-mediated
              interactions, and attempt to derive pairwise models. Different
              equations are appropriate depending on whether a mediator is
              consumable or reusable, whether an interaction is mediated by one
              or more mediators, and sometimes even on quantitative details of
              the community (e.g. relative fitness of the two species, initial
              conditions). Our results, combined with potential violation of
              the additivity assumption in many-species communities, suggest
              that pairwise modeling will often fail to predict microbial

              (MAL-ED), we describe the epidemiology and impact of
              Campylobacter infection in the first 2 years of life. METHODS:
              Children were actively followed up until 24 months of age.
              Diarrheal and nondiarrheal stool samples were collected and
              tested by enzyme immunoassay for Campylobacter Stool and blood
              samples were assayed for markers of intestinal permeability and
              inflammation. RESULTS: A total of 1892 children had 7601
              diarrheal and 26 267 nondiarrheal stool samples tested for
              Campylobacter We describe a high prevalence of infection, with
              most children (n = 1606; 84.9\%) having a Campylobacter-positive
              stool sample by 1 year of age. Factors associated with a reduced
              risk of Campylobacter detection included exclusive breastfeeding
              (risk ratio, 0.57; 95\% confidence interval, .47-.67), treatment
              of drinking water (0.76; 0.70-0.83), access to an improved
              latrine (0.89; 0.82-0.97), and recent macrolide antibiotic use
              (0.68; 0.63-0.74). A high Campylobacter burden was associated
              with a lower length-for-age Z score at 24 months (-1.82; 95\%
              confidence interval, -1.94 to -1.70) compared with a low burden
              (-1.49; -1.60 to -1.38). This association was robust to
              confounders and consistent across sites. Campylobacter infection
              was also associated with increased intestinal permeability and
              intestinal and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter
              was prevalent across diverse settings and associated with growth
              shortfalls. Promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, drinking water
              treatment, improved latrines, and targeted antibiotic treatment

              Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.
              (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494). Setting: Two academic medical
              centers. Patients: 46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of
              CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most
              recent acute episode. Intervention: Fecal microbiota
              transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own
              stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy. Measurements: The
              primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for
              further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data
              were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse
              events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for
              6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on
              patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.
              Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients
              (90.9\%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared
              with 15 of 24 (62.5\%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042).
              Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6
              of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI
              after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent
              donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored
              gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble

              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many
              alternative network structures, all equally consistent with
              available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble.
              This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction
              methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance
              Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting
              growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be
              included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential
              genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential
              genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some
              metabolic subsystems contributed disproportionately to the set of
              predicted essential reactions in a way that was unique to each
              Streptococcus species, leading to species-specific outcomes from
              small molecule interactions. Through our analyses of P.
              aeruginosa and six Streptococci, we show that ensembles increase
              the quality of predictions without drastically increasing
              reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical
              for applications which require predictions for many non-model
              organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are

              difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices
              proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general
              properties of communities that allow us to compare different
              regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of
              fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and
              conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices
              are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common
              diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical
              analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited
              for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around
              the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland
              plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore
              relationships between the common diversity indices of species
              richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D1),
              Simpson's dominance (D2), Simpson's evenness (E), and
              Berger-Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices
              for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground
              arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P. lanceolata
              molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based
              measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they
              behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We
              used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected
              more relationships between diversities of different organisms and
              traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths
              were significant when using H', even though all models except
              that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while
              common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple
              analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of
              index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data
              mining in order to identify the index producing the most
              significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously
              considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater

              been in use since the late 1970s. The eight microorganisms
              composing the ASF were all derived from mice, can be cultured in

              least 15 years or more by the authors) in gnotobiotic mice

              utilizing different carbon sources with in vivo growth data. This
              comparison results in two types of model-prediction
              inconsistencies; either the model predicts growth when no growth
              is observed in the experiment (GNG inconsistencies) or the model
              predicts no growth when the experiment reveals growth (NGG
              inconsistencies). Here we propose an optimization-based
              framework, GrowMatch, to automatically reconcile GNG predictions
              (by suppressing functionalities in the model) and NGG predictions
              (by adding functionalities to the model). We use GrowMatch to
              resolve inconsistencies between the predictions of the latest in
              silico Escherichia coli (iAF1260) model and the in vivo data
              available in the Keio collection and improved the consistency of
              in silico with in vivo predictions from 90.6\% to 96.7\%.
              Specifically, we were able to suggest consistency-restoring
              hypotheses for 56/72 GNG mutants and 13/38 NGG mutants. GrowMatch
              resolved 18 GNG inconsistencies by suggesting suppressions in the
              mutant metabolic networks. Fifteen inconsistencies were resolved
              by suppressing isozymes in the metabolic network, and the
              remaining 23 GNG mutants corresponding to blocked genes were
              resolved by suitably modifying the biomass equation of iAF1260.
              GrowMatch suggested consistency-restoring hypotheses for five NGG
              mutants by adding functionalities to the model whereas the
              remaining eight inconsistencies were resolved by pinpointing
              possible alternate genes that carry out the function of the

              nonintuitive model modification hypotheses that would have been
              difficult to pinpoint through inspection alone. In addition,
              GrowMatch can be used during the construction phase of new, as

              environmental samples is widely used in studies of microbial
              ecology as a measure of microbial community structure and
              diversity. However, the genomic copy number of the 16S gene
              varies greatly - from one in many species to up to 15 in some
              bacteria and to hundreds in some microbial eukaryotes. As a
              result of this variation the relative abundance of 16S genes in
              environmental samples can be attributed both to variation in the
              relative abundance of different organisms, and to variation in
              genomic 16S copy number among those organisms. Despite this fact,
              many studies assume that the abundance of 16S gene sequences is a
              surrogate measure of the relative abundance of the organisms
              containing those sequences. Here we present a method that uses
              data on sequences and genomic copy number of 16S genes along with
              phylogenetic placement and ancestral state estimation to estimate
              organismal abundances from environmental DNA sequence data. We
              use theory and simulations to demonstrate that 16S genomic copy
              number can be accurately estimated from the short reads typically
              obtained from high-throughput environmental sequencing of the 16S

              more strongly correlated with estimated abundances obtained from

              different inferences about community diversity and structure and
              the identity of the dominant taxa in microbial communities. Our

              (microbiota) and the host environment that they inhabit-has
              changed clinicians' ideas about microbes in human health and
              disease. Perhaps the most radical change is the realization that
              most of the microbes that inhabit our body supply crucial
              ecosystem services that benefit the entire host-microbe system.
              These services include the production of important resources,
              bioconversion of nutrients, and protection against pathogenic
              microbes. Thus disease can result from a loss of beneficial
              functions or the introduction of maladaptive functions by
              invading microbes. This review will show how an understanding of
              the dynamics and function of the indigenous microbiota has
              altered our view of microbes in maintaining homeostasis and
              causing disease. It will discuss how disruption of the beneficial
              functions of the microbiota can lead to disease. Methods for
              studying the microbiota will be introduced as part of a
              conceptual framework for using these methods to delineate novel
              roles for microbes in health. Key associations between specific
              changes in the microbiome and disease will be discussed. This
              will lead to an explanation of how the intentional manipulation
              of the microbiota, either by restoring missing functions or
              eliminating harmful functions, may lead to novel methods to
              prevent or treat a variety of diseases. With the explosion of

  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in

              intestinal mucus layer of rodents and other animals and has been
              suggested to be a pathobiont, a commensal that plays a role in
              disease. In order to gain insights into its lifestyle, we
              analyzed the genome and transcriptome of M. schaedleri ASF 457
              and performed physiological experiments to test traits predicted
              by its genome. Although described as a mucus inhabitant, M.
              schaedleri has limited capacity for degrading host-derived
              mucosal glycans and other complex polysaccharides. Additionally,
              M. schaedleri reduces nitrate and expresses systems for
              scavenging oxygen and reactive oxygen species in vivo, which may
              account for its localization close to the mucosal tissue and
              expansion during inflammation. Also of note, M. schaedleri
              harbors a type VI secretion system and putative effector proteins
              and can modify gene expression in mucosal tissue, suggesting
              intimate interactions with its host and a possible role in
              inflammation. The M. schaedleri genome has been shaped by
              extensive horizontal gene transfer, primarily from intestinal
              Epsilon- and Deltaproteobacteria, indicating that horizontal gene
              transfer has played a key role in defining its niche in the gut
              ecosystem. IMPORTANCE Shifts in gut microbiota composition have
              been associated with intestinal inflammation, but it remains
              unclear whether inflammation-associated bacteria are commensal or
              detrimental to their host. Here, we studied the lifestyle of the
              gut bacterium Mucispirillum schaedleri, which is associated with
              inflammation in widely used mouse models. We found that M.
              schaedleri has specialized systems to handle oxidative stress
              during inflammation. Additionally, it expresses secretion systems
              and effector proteins and can modify the mucosal gene expression
              of its host. This suggests that M. schaedleri undergoes intimate
              interactions with its host and may play a role in inflammation.
              The insights presented here aid our understanding of how
              commensal gut bacteria may be involved in altering susceptibility

              these ASF species-including potential for interactions such as

              results through dynamic growth measurements and non-targeted

              rare (32 of 3570 possible cases), but is enriched between
              Clostridium ASF356 and Parabacteroides ASF519. We identified many

              treating mice with selective antibiotics. Mice from different

              animals lacking Th17 cells acquired them after introduction of
              bacteria from Th17 cell-sufficient mice. Differentiation of Th17
