  abstract = "Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on an unknown
              gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium isolated
              from human clinical specimens. This organism was indole negative,
              resistant to 20\% bile, produced acetic and a lesser amount of
              succinic acids as the major end products of glucose metabolism,
              and possessed a G+C content of approximately 43 mol\%.
              Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the
              unidentified bacterium was a member of the
              Cytophaga-Flavobacter-Bacteroides phylum of gram-negative
              bacteria and formed a close association (with an average sequence
              similarity of 93.6\%) with the second subcluster of the
              Porphyromonas cluster in the Bacteroides subgroup.
              Phylogenetically and phenotypically it resembled Bacteroides
              merdae; however, a 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence of
              approximately 5.5\% between the unknown bacterium and B. merdae,
              as well as distinguishable biochemical characteristics,
              demonstrate that the unknown bacterium is genotypically and
              phenotypically distinct and represents a previously unknown
              subline within the Porphyromonas phylogenetic cluster.
              Furthermore, a DNA-DNA reassociation value of 17.8\% between
              isolates WAL 12034(T) (the type strain of this novel taxon) and
              ATCC 43184(T) (B. merdae type strain) also documented the
              separateness of the unknown species and B. merdae. Based on the
              phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a new species,
              ``Bacteroides goldsteinii sp. nov,'' is proposed. The G+C content
              of the DNA is 43 mol\% for Bacteroides. The type strain of ``B.
              goldsteinii'' is WAL 12034(T) (= CCUG 48944(T) = ATCC

  abstract = "Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for
              analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established
              paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a
              promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical
              repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling
              techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little
              emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged
              constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure
              co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint,
              the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other
              microbes in the community. This is particularly important for
              predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes
              significant restrictions on the allowable community membership,
              composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the
              SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux
              distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement.
              SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear
              programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is
              independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage
              of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis.
              SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four E. coli
              double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut
              microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives
              from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and
              Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom
              is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to
              changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on
              the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an
              abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut
              microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step
              towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a
              microbial community in a given environment.",

              highly diverse and it is therefore challenging to assign specific
              properties to its individual members. Here, we have used a
              collection of murine bacterial strains and a modular design
              approach to create a minimal bacterial community that, once
              established in germ-free mice, provided colonization resistance
              against the human enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
              Typhimurium (S. Tm). Initially, a community of 12 strains, termed
              Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (Oligo-MM12), representing members of the
              major bacterial phyla in the murine gut, was selected. This
              community was stable over consecutive mouse generations and
              provided colonization resistance against S. Tm infection, albeit
              not to the degree of a conventional complex microbiota.
              Comparative (meta)genome analyses identified functions
              represented in a conventional microbiome but absent from the
              Oligo-MM12. By genome-informed design, we created an improved
              version of the Oligo-MM community harbouring three facultative
              anaerobic bacteria from the mouse intestinal bacterial collection
              (miBC) that provided conventional-like colonization resistance.
              In conclusion, we have established a highly versatile
              experimental system that showed efficacy in an enteric infection
              model. Thus, in combination with exhaustive bacterial strain
              collections and systems-based approaches, genome-guided design

              microbiota interact with each other, as well as with the host, is
              daunting. The altered Schaedler flora (ASF) is a model community
              of eight microorganisms that was developed by R.P. Orcutt and has
              been in use since the late 1970s. The eight microorganisms
              composing the ASF were all derived from mice, can be cultured in
              vitro, and are stably passed through multiple generations (at
              least 15 years or more by the authors) in gnotobiotic mice
              continually bred in isolator facilities. With the limitations
              associated with conventional, mono- or biassociated, and germfree
              mice, use of mice colonized with a consortium of known bacteria
              that naturally inhabit the murine gut offers a powerful system to
              investigate mechanisms governing host-microbiota relationships,

              The ASF community offers significant advantages to study
              homeostatic as well as disease-related interactions by taking
              advantage of a well-defined, limited community of microorganisms.
              For example, quantification and spatial distribution of
              individual members, microbial genetic manipulation, genomic-scale
              analysis, and identification of microorganism-specific host
              immune responses are all achievable using the ASF model. This

              propionate formation using genomic and metagenomic analysis of
              the human gut microbiota and by designing degenerate primer sets
              for the detection of diagnostic genes for these pathways.
              Degenerate primers for the acrylate pathway (detecting the lcdA
              gene, encoding lactoyl-CoA dehydratase) together with metagenomic
              mining revealed that this pathway is restricted to only a few
              human colonic species within the Lachnospiraceae and
              Negativicutes. The operation of this pathway for lactate
              utilisation in Coprococcus catus (Lachnospiraceae) was confirmed
              using stable isotope labelling. The propanediol pathway that
              processes deoxy sugars such as fucose and rhamnose was more
              abundant within the Lachnospiraceae (based on the pduP gene,
              which encodes propionaldehyde dehydrogenase), occurring in
              relatives of Ruminococcus obeum and in Roseburia inulinivorans.
              The dominant source of propionate from hexose sugars, however,
              was concluded to be the succinate pathway, as indicated by the
              widespread distribution of the mmdA gene that encodes
              methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase in the Bacteroidetes and in many
              Negativicutes. In general, the capacity to produce propionate or
              butyrate from hexose sugars resided in different species,
              although two species of Lachnospiraceae (C. catus and R.
              inulinivorans) are now known to be able to switch from butyrate
              to propionate production on different substrates. A better
              understanding of the microbial ecology of short-chain fatty acid

              Of the many challenges bacteria face in making a living, perhaps

              balance, and acquiring carbon and nitrogen to synthesize primary
              metabolites. The ability of bacteria to meet these challenges
              depends heavily on the rest of their community. Indeed, the most

              methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
              networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes
              with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA
              methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular
              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

              species, whose activities have tremendous impact on the plants,
              animals and humans they associate with. The ability to predict
              the structure of these complex communities is crucial to
              understanding and managing them. Here, we propose a simple,
              qualitative assembly rule that predicts community structure from
              the outcomes of competitions between small sets of species, and
              experimentally assess its predictive power using synthetic
              microbial communities composed of up to eight soil bacterial
              species. Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable
              community, whose composition was independent of the initial

              Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between

              define the signatures that were most important throughout

              carbohydrates decrease in abundance over time in the mouse cecum

              C. difficile physiology between the different time points

              how important the availability of amino acids and other nutrients
              is for the initial stages of C. difficile colonization and

              difficile in the gut will be important for developing new
              targeted bacterial therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile
              is a bacterial pathogen of global significance that is a major
              cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antibiotics deplete the
              indigenous gut microbiota and change the metabolic environment in
              the gut to one favoring C. difficile growth. Here we used
              metabolomics and transcriptomics to define the gut environment
              after antibiotics and during the initial stages of C. difficile
              colonization and infection. We show that amino acids, in
              particular, proline and branched-chain amino acids, and
              carbohydrates decrease in abundance over time and that C.
              difficile gene expression is consistent with their utilization by
              the bacterium in vivo. We employed an integrated approach to
              analyze the metabolome and transcriptome to identify associations
              between metabolites and transcripts. This highlighted the
              importance of key nutrients in the early stages of colonization,
              and the data provide a rationale for the development of therapies
              based on the use of bacteria that specifically compete for
              nutrients that are essential for C. difficile colonization and

               smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is

              has combined both factors. The present studies were carried out

              These mice do not develop IBD in germfree conditions, implicating
              undefined intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of lesions. In

              strains by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Three strains were
              previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF
              360), Lactobacillus salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides
              distasonis (strain ASF 519) based on phenotypic criteria. 16S
              rRNA analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from
              its presumptive identity. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361
              is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type
              strains of Lactobacillus murinis and Lactobacillus animalis (both
              isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to
              a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that
              clusters with L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus lactis. Strain ASF
              519 falls into an unnamed genus containing [Bacteroides]
              distasonis, [Bacteroides] merdae, [Bacteroides] forsythus, and

              Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum and is most closely
              related to the genus Porphyromonas. The spiral-shaped strain,
              strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum and exhibits
              sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson. The
              remaining four ASF strains, which are extremely oxygen-sensitive

              low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes,

              into Clostridium cluster XIV of Collins et al. Morphologically,
              ASF 492 resembles members of this cluster, Roseburia cecicola,
              and Eubacterium plexicaudatum. The 16S rRNA sequence of ASF 492
              is identical to that of E. plexicaudatum. Since the type strain
              and other viable original isolates of E. plexicaudatum have been
              lost, strain ASF 492 is a candidate for a neotype strain. Strain

              phylogenetic tree but is not closely related to any organisms

              high-throughput pyrosequencing. In contrast to conventional mice

              highly susceptible to S. enterica induced colonization and
              enterocolitis. Colonization resistance was partially restored in
              LCM-animals by co-housing with conventional mice for 21 days
              (LCM(con21)). 16S rRNA sequence analysis comparing LCM,
              LCM(con21) and CON gut microbiota revealed that gut microbiota
              complexity increased upon conventionalization and correlated with
              increased resistance to S. enterica infection. Comparative
              microbiota analysis of mice with varying degrees of colonization
              resistance allowed us to identify intestinal ecosystem
              characteristics associated with susceptibility to S. enterica
              infection. Moreover, this system enabled us to gain further
              insights into the general principles of gut ecosystem invasion by
              non-pathogenic, commensal bacteria. Mice harboring high commensal
              E. coli densities were more susceptible to S. enterica induced
              gut inflammation. Similarly, mice with high titers of
              Lactobacilli were more efficiently colonized by a commensal
              Lactobacillus reuteri(RR) strain after oral inoculation. Upon
              examination of 16S rRNA sequence data from 9 CON mice we found
              that closely related phylotypes generally display significantly
              correlated abundances (co-occurrence), more so than distantly
              related phylotypes. Thus, in essence, the presence of closely
              related species can increase the chance of invasion of newly
              incoming species into the gut ecosystem. We provide evidence that
              this principle might be of general validity for invasion of
              bacteria in preformed gut ecosystems. This might be of relevance

              the binary ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDT (Clostridium

              immunofluorescence microscopy that CDT and other binary

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single
              most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction
              (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires
              that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain
              orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired
              amplification. The process of designing specific primers
              typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking
              regions of interest are generated either manually or using
              software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate
              nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine
              the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process
              as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets,
              such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer
              orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers.
              The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a
              time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when
              the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although
              the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target
              detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as
              BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily
              return complete match information over the entire primer range.
              RESULTS: We present a new software tool called Primer-BLAST to
              alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers.
              This tool combines BLAST with a global alignment algorithm to
              ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to
              detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to
              primers. Primer-BLAST allows users to design new target-specific
              primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of
              pre-existing primers. Primer-BLAST also supports placing primers
              based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) sites in primers. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a
              robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool
              that designs target-specific PCR primers. Primer-BLAST offers
              flexible options to adjust the specificity threshold and other
              primer properties. This tool is publicly available at

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The human intestine is colonized with trillions of
              microorganisms important to health and disease. There has been an
              intensive effort to catalog the species and genetic content of
              this microbial ecosystem. However, little is known of the

              understanding the dynamics and stability of this host-associated
              microbial community. Here we perform a systematic investigation
              of public goods-based syntrophic interactions among the abundant
              human gut bacteria, the Bacteroidales. RESULTS: We find evidence
              for a rich interaction network based on the breakdown and use of
              polysaccharides. Species that utilize a particular polysaccharide
              (producers) liberate polysaccharide breakdown products (PBPs)
              that are consumed by other species unable to grow on the
              polysaccharide alone (recipients). Cross-species gene addition
              experiments demonstrate that recipients can grow on a
              polysaccharide if the producer-derived glycoside hydrolase,
              responsible for PBP generation, is provided. These
              producer-derived glycoside hydrolases are public goods
              transported extracellularly in outer membrane vesicles allowing
              for the creation of PBP and concomitant recipient growth
              spatially distant from the producer. Recipients can exploit these
              ecological interactions and conditionally outgrow producers.
              Finally, we show that these public goods-based interactions occur
              among Bacteroidales species coresident within a natural human

              goods-based syntrophic interactions between bacterial members of
              the human gut microbial ecosystem. This polysaccharide-based
              network likely represents foundational relationships creating

  abstract = "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of
              hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk
              factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior
              exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial
              community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple
              antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility,
              many leading to distinct community structures stemming from
              variation in bacterial targets of action. These community
              structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile.
              Therefore, we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its
              physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments.
              Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated that C. difficile
              highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three
              antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore
              formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the
              antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C.
              difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient
              concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the
              bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C.
              difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This
              revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways
              for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C.
              difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model
              with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm
              integrating network architecture. This platform identified
              nutrients that C. difficile used preferentially between
              pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass
              spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the
              hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches
              across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for
              nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland
              fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans. IMPORTANCE
              Infection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an
              inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life threatening
              and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection.
              Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated
              with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut
              microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In
              this study, we demonstrated that C. difficile altered
              pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from
              separate classes and exploited different nutrient sources across
              these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also
              provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens
              during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile
              colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of
              bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could
              explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal
              microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment
              for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the
              identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that
              prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization, including pre- and
              probiotic therapies.",

              Clostridium difficile is a major cause of morbidity and increased

              culture model of the cecal flora to investigate the possibility
              that competition for nutrients is one mechanism for this
              antagonism. The medium for the CF cultures consisted of
              homogenates of fecal pellets from germfree mice. Carbohydrate
              analysis showed that mouse flora depleted 74 to 99.8\% of the
              various carbohydrates from this environment-simulating medium.
              When inoculated into filtrates made from CF cultures of mouse
              flora, C. difficile multiplied slower than the dilution rate of
              the CF cultures unless glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or

              optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between

              genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems

              metabonomic studies. The method refines a segmentation of
              reference and test spectra in a top-down fashion, sequentially
              subdividing the initial larger segments, as required, to improve
              the local spectral alignment. We also describe a general
              procedure that allows robust comparison of realignment quality of
              various available methods for a range of peak intensities. The

              functionally important group of bacteria. Human colonic butyrate
              producers are Gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically
              diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to Eubacterium
              rectale/Roseburia spp. and to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Five
              different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the
              central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most
              cases butyryl-CoA : acetate CoA-transferase, rather than butyrate
              kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis.
              Mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut Clostridium
              spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation
              via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients.
              Here we suggest that these mechanisms also apply to the majority

              under anaerobic conditions in the absence of electron acceptors.
              The yields on these substrates exhibited significant differences
              when measured in carbon-limited chemostats at similar growth
              rates and compared in terms of grams (dry weight) of cells
              produced per mole of hexose utilized. Maltohexaose was the most
              efficiently utilized substrate, and galactose was the least
              efficiently utilized under these conditions. All these sugars
              were known to be metabolized to glucose 6-phosphate and produced
              the same pattern of fermentation products. The differences in
              growth yields were ascribed to differences in energy costs for
              transport and phosphorylation of these sugars. A formalized
              treatment of these factors in determining growth yields was
              established and used to obtain values for the cost of transport

              of substrates via proton symport and binding-protein-dependent
              mechanisms in vivo. By this approach, the proton-lactose
              stoichiometry was found to be 1.1 to 1.8 H+ per lactose,
              equivalent to approximately 0.5 ATP used per lactose transported.
              The cost of transporting maltose via a binding-protein-dependent
              mechanism was considerably higher, being over 1 to 1.2 ATP per
              maltose or maltodextrin transported. The formalized treatment
              also permitted estimation of the net ATP yield from the
              metabolism of these sugars; it was calculated that the growth
              yield data were consistent with the production of 2.8 to 3.2 ATP

              increasingly being used to carry out a specific biochemical
              function in lieu of engineering a single microbe to do the same
              task. However, knowing how different species' metabolisms will
              integrate to reach a desired outcome is a difficult problem that
              has been studied in great detail using steady-state models.
              However, many biotechnological processes, as well as natural
              habitats, represent a more dynamic system. Examining how
              individual species use resources in their growth medium or
              environment (exometabolomics) over time in batch culture
              conditions can provide rich phenotypic data that encompasses
              regulation and transporters, creating an opportunity to integrate
              the data into a predictive model of resource use by a mixed
              community. RESULTS: Here we use exometabolomic profiling to
              examine the time-varying substrate depletion from a mixture of 19
              amino acids and glucose by two Pseudomonas and one Bacillus
              species isolated from ground water. Contrary to studies in model
              organisms, we found surprisingly few correlations between
              resource preferences and maximal growth rate or biomass
              composition. We then modeled patterns of substrate depletion, and
              used these models to examine if substrate usage preferences and
              substrate depletion kinetics of individual isolates can be used
              to predict the metabolism of a co-culture of the isolates. We
              found that most of the substrates fit the model predictions,
              except for glucose and histidine, which were depleted more slowly
              than predicted, and proline, glycine, glutamate, lysine and
              arginine, which were all consumed significantly faster.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a significant portion of a
              model community's overall metabolism can be predicted based on
              the metabolism of the individuals. Based on the nature of our
              model, the resources that significantly deviate from the
              prediction highlight potential metabolic pathways affected by
              species-species interactions, which when further studied can

              numbers of the ASF strains were determined in the different
              regions of the GI tracts of three C.B-17 SCID mice. Individual

              five-carbon platform chemical that can be used for the synthesis
              of polymers and other chemicals of industrial interest. Enzymatic
              conversion of L-lysine to 5AVA has been achieved by employing
              lysine 2-monooxygenase encoded by the davB gene and
              5-aminovaleramidase encoded by the davA gene. Additionally, a
              recombinant Escherichia coli strain expressing the davB and davA
              genes has been developed for bioconversion of L-lysine to 5AVA.
              To use glucose and xylose derived from lignocellulosic biomass as
              substrates, rather than L-lysine as a substrate, we previously
              examined direct fermentative production of 5AVA from glucose by
              metabolically engineered E. coli strains. However, the yield and
              productivity of 5AVA achieved by recombinant E. coli strains
              remain very low. Thus, Corynebacterium glutamicum, a highly
              efficient L-lysine producing microorganism, should be useful in
              the development of direct fermentative production of 5AVA using
              L-lysine as a precursor for 5AVA. Here, we report the development
              of metabolically engineered C. glutamicum strains for enhanced
              fermentative production of 5AVA from glucose. RESULTS: Various
              expression vectors containing different promoters and origins of
              replication were examined for optimal expression of Pseudomonas
              putida davB and davA genes encoding lysine 2-monooxygenase and
              delta-aminovaleramidase, respectively. Among them, expression of
              the C. glutamicum codon-optimized davA gene fused with His6-Tag
              at its N-Terminal and the davB gene as an operon under a strong
              synthetic H36 promoter (plasmid p36davAB3) in C. glutamicum
              enabled the most efficient production of 5AVA. Flask culture and
              fed-batch culture of this strain produced 6.9 and 19.7 g/L
              (together with 11.9 g/L glutaric acid as major byproduct) of
              5AVA, respectively. Homology modeling suggested that endogenous
              gamma-aminobutyrate aminotransferase encoded by the gabT gene
              might be responsible for the conversion of 5AVA to glutaric acid
              in recombinant C. glutamicum. Fed-batch culture of a C.
              glutamicum gabT mutant-harboring p36davAB3 produced 33.1 g/L 5AVA
              with much reduced (2.0 g/L) production of glutaric acid.
              CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium glutamicum was successfully
              engineered to produce 5AVA from glucose by optimizing the
              expression of two key enzymes, lysine 2-monooxygenase and
              delta-aminovaleramidase. In addition, production of glutaric
              acid, a major byproduct, was significantly reduced by employing
              C. glutamicum gabT mutant as a host strain. The metabolically

              identification of ``essential'' genes that are important for
              bacterial survival and growth. RESULTS: We have developed a
              robust microarray and PCR-based method, Transposon-Mediated
              Differential Hybridisation (TMDH), that uses novel bioinformatics
              to identify transposon inserts in genome-wide libraries.
              Following a microarray-based screen, genes lacking transposon
              inserts are re-tested using a PCR and sequencing-based approach.
              We carried out a TMDH analysis of the S. aureus genome using a
              large random mariner transposon library of around a million
              mutants, and identified a total of 351 S. aureus genes important

              methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
              networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes
              with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA
              methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular
              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In spite of its great promise, metabolomics has
              proven difficult to execute in an untargeted and generalizable
              manner. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has made
              it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites.
              However, matching metabolites to their spectral features
              continues to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected
              information remains uninterpreted and that new metabolites are
              seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges require
              new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in
              curated biochemistry databases. DESCRIPTION: Here we present
              Metabolic In silico Network Expansions (MINEs), an extension of
              known metabolite databases to include molecules that have not
              been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites
              and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called
              the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE)
              and expert-curated reaction rules based on the Enzyme Commission
              classification system to propose the novel chemical structures
              and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the
              Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database,
              the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds, of which 93\% are not
              present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds
              have on average higher structural similarity to natural products
              than compounds from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to
              propose annotations for 98.6\% of a set of 667 MassBank spectra,
              14\% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem while
              returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs.
              1715 median candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate
              mass data enabled the identity of an unknown peak to be
              confidently predicted. CONCLUSIONS: MINE databases are freely
              accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at
              http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov and developer-friendly APIs.
              MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared to
              general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant
              synthetic compounds. Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on
              previous in silico generated compound databases that focus on
              human metabolism. We are actively developing the database; future
              versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules
              for spontaneous chemical reactions and more advanced filtering
              and prioritization of candidate structures. Graphical

              detected an aldole cleavage activity of L-threonine in crude
              extracts with an activity of 2.2 nmol min(-1) (mg of
              protein)(-1). In order to discover the molecular reason for this
              activity, we cloned glyA, encoding serine
              hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). By using affinity-tagged glyA,
              SHMT was isolated and its substrate specificity was determined.
              The aldole cleavage activity of purified SHMT with L-threonine as
              the substrate was 1.3 micromol min(-1) (mg of protein)(-1), which
              was 4\% of that with L-serine as substrate. Reduction of SHMT
              activity in vivo was obtained by placing the essential glyA gene
              in the chromosome under the control of P(tac), making glyA
              expression isopropylthiogalactopyranoside dependent. In this way,
              the SHMT activity in an L-threonine producer was reduced to 8\%
              of the initial activity, which led to a 41\% reduction in
              glycine, while L-threonine was simultaneously increased by 49\%.
              The intracellular availability of L-threonine to aldole cleavage
              was also reduced by overexpressing the L-threonine exporter thrE.
              In C. glutamicum DR-17, which overexpresses thrE, accumulation of
              67 mM instead of 49 mM L-threonine was obtained. This shows that
              the potential for amino acid formation can be considerably

              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network

              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many

              of molecular evolution. In contrast, relatively little is known
              about the long-term evolution of species' phenotypic and genetic
              properties. This represents an important gap in our understanding
              of evolution, as exactly these proprieties play key roles in
              natural selection and adaptation to diverse environments. Here we
              perform a comparative analysis of bacterial growth and gene
              deletion phenotypes using hundreds of genome-scale metabolic
              models. Overall, bacterial phenotypic evolution can be described
              by a two-stage process with a rapid initial phenotypic
              diversification followed by a slow long-term exponential
              divergence. The observed average divergence trend, with
              approximately similar fractions of phenotypic properties changing
              per unit time, continues for billions of years. We experimentally
              confirm the predicted divergence trend using the phenotypic
              profiles of 40 diverse bacterial species across more than 60
              growth conditions. Our analysis suggests that, at long
              evolutionary distances, gene essentiality is significantly more
              conserved than the ability to utilize different nutrients, while
              synthetic lethality is significantly less conserved. We also find
              that although a rapid phenotypic evolution is sometimes observed
              within the same species, a transition from high to low phenotypic
              similarity occurs primarily at the genus level.",

               flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome‐scale metabolic models
               (GEMs). However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway
               usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein
               expression in the wild‐type and evolved strains. Here, we report
               that >98\% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions
               are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover,
               when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the
               evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth
               predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal
               growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage
               limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are
               overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory
               processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal

               downregulation of known regulons and stringent response
               suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from

               growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM‐computed
               optimal growth states. \#\#\# Synopsis When prokaryotes are
               maintained at early‐ to mid‐log phase growth through serial
               passaging for hundreds of generations, the strains improve
               fitness and evolve a higher growth rate ([Lenski and Travisano,
               1994][1]; [Ibarra et al , 2002][2]). This increased growth rate
               is the result of the appearance of a few causal mutations
               ([Herring et al , 2006][3]; [Conrad et al , 2009][4]). In
               Escherichia coli , these altered growth phenotypes are
               consistent with predictions from genome‐scale models of
               metabolism (GEMs) ([Ibarra et al , 2002][2]; [Fong and Palsson,
               2004][5]). However, it is still not known (1) whether absolute
               gene and protein expression levels and expression changes are
               consistent with optimal growth predictions from in silico GEMs
               or (2) whether measured expression changes can be linked to
               physiological changes that are based on known mechanisms or
               pathways. In this study, we begin to address these questions
               using constraint‐based modeling of E. coli K‐12 metabolism
               ([Feist and Palsson, 2008][6]) to analyze omic data that
               document the expression changes in E. coli under adaptive
               evolution in three different growth conditions. Mapping
               high‐throughput data to a network can be useful for
               interpretation. However, it does not account for upstream and
               downstream effects of gene and protein expression changes. The
               analysis of data in the context of GEMs can suggest if predicted
               activity is consistent with the data. For this work, we used a
               variant of flux balance analysis (FBA), called Parsimonious
               enzyme usage FBA (pFBA) ([Figure 1][7]), to classify all genes
               according to whether they are used in the optimal growth
               solutions. Results from these models were compared with the data
               to assess whether the data were consistent with genes and
               proteins within the predicted optimal solutions, and whether the
               expression changes were consistent with measured physiology.
               Through this analysis, we find that the data provide a high
               coverage of genes that contribute to the optimal growth
               solutions ([Figure 1B][7]). In fact, the union of the proteomic
               and transcriptomic data for non‐essential genes provides support
               for 97.7\% of all non‐essential gene‐associated reactions within
               the optimal growth predictions. Thus, the spectrum of expressed
               genes and proteins is consistent with the pathway utilization
               that is predicted for these optimal growth phenotypes.
               Laboratory‐evolved strains attain a higher growth rate. This
               higher growth rate is usually associated with an increased
               substrate uptake rate ([Ibarra et al , 2002][2]; [Fong et al ,
               2005][8]) and in some cases more efficient metabolism ([Ibarra
               et al , 2002][2]). Both of these properties are also witnessed
               in the strains studied here. It has been reported that in most
               cases, evolved strain growth phenotype is consistent with GEM
               predictions ([Ibarra et al , 2002][2]; [Teusink et al ,
               2009][9]). Here, we evaluate whether the laboratory‐evolved
               strains adjust the gene and protein expression levels in
               accordance with pathway usage in the optimal growth predictions.
               Essential and non‐essential genes and proteins within the
               optimal growth solutions are significantly upregulated ([Figure
               1B][7]). This suggests that these proteins may be acting as
               bottlenecks that are relieved through the adaptive process,
               thereby allowing for a higher substrate uptake rate and growth
               rate. However, genes and proteins associated with reactions that
               cannot carry a flux in the given growth conditions are
               downregulated in the evolved strains ([Figure 1B][7]).
               Furthermore, there is downregulation of genes associated with
               less efficient pathways ([Figure 5C][10]). Thus, the omic data
               support the emergence of the predicted optimal growth states,
               consistent with the increased substrate uptake upstream and the
               increased biomass production downstream of these internal
               pathways. Regulatory mechanisms, both known and unknown, are
               responsible for the changes seen here. Across all data sets,
               several metabolic regulons are significantly downregulated.
               However, no known regulons were enriched among upregulated genes
               or proteins for all but one data set. Aside from just regulating
               the metabolic pathways directly, these mechanisms lead to
               additional physiological changes. For example, in the minimal
               media growth conditions used here, the stringent response
               normally represses growth while upregulating amino‐acid
               biosynthetic processes. However, evolved strain gene expression
               shows a suppression of the stringent response, as evolved strain
               gene expression shows either no expression change or changes
               opposite to the normal stringent response. The implications of
               this work are as follows: (1) genome‐scale gene and protein
               expression data are consistent with FBA computed optimal growth
               states, and evolved strains reinforce these optimal states; (2)
               genome‐scale models will have an important function bridging the
               gap between genotype and phenotype; and (3) the development of
               additional genome‐scale models of other growth‐related processes
               such as transcription and translation ([Thiele et al ,
               2009][11]) will have an important function in elucidating the
               mechanisms that contribute the most to altered phenotypes
               ([Lewis et al , 2009a][12]). In addition, reconstruction of the
               transcriptional regulation network will aid in identifying the
               control of expression changes seen in the other systems. Mol

              proposing the addition of reactions to genome-scale metabolic
              models to permit those models to run correctly. Gap filling
              completes what are otherwise incomplete models that lack fully
              connected metabolic networks. The models are incomplete because
              they are derived from annotated genomes in which not all enzymes
              have been identified. Here we compare the results of applying an
              automated likelihood-based gap filler within the Pathway Tools
              software with the results of manually gap filling the same
              metabolic model. Both gap-filling exercises were applied to the
              same genome-derived qualitative metabolic reconstruction for
              Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum JCM 1217, and to the same
              modeling conditions - anaerobic growth under four nutrients
              producing 53 biomass metabolites. RESULTS: The solution computed
              by the gap-filling program GenDev contained 12 reactions, but
              closer examination showed that solution was not minimal; two of
              the twelve reactions can be removed to yield a set of ten
              reactions that enable model growth. The manually curated solution
              contained 13 reactions, eight of which were shared with the
              12-reaction computed solution. Thus, GenDev achieved recall of
              61.5\% and precision of 66.6\%. These results suggest that
              although computational gap fillers are populating metabolic
              models with significant numbers of correct reactions,
              automatically gap-filled metabolic models also contain
              significant numbers of incorrect reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our

              between the manual and automatic solutions resulted from using

  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in
              reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally,
              our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into

              methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
              networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes
              with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA
              methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular
              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

              increasing. So far the predictive capability of these methods has
              not been critically evaluated and compared. This work presents a
              survey of recently published methods that use transcript levels
              to try to improve metabolic flux predictions either by generating
              flux distributions or by creating context-specific models. A
              subset of these methods is then systematically evaluated using
              published data from three different case studies in E. coli and
              S. cerevisiae. The flux predictions made by different methods

              multiplicity in the possible steady-state flux distributions that
              are compatible with stoichiometric constraints. This space of
              possibilities is largest in the frequent situation where the
              nutrients available to the cells are unknown. These two factors:
              network size and lack of knowledge of nutrient availability,
              challenge the identification of the actual metabolic state of
              living cells among the myriad possibilities. Here we address this
              challenge by developing a method that integrates gene-expression
              measurements with genome-scale models of metabolism as a means of
              inferring metabolic states. Our method explores the space of
              alternative flux distributions that maximize the agreement
              between gene expression and metabolic fluxes, and thereby
              identifies reactions that are likely to be active in the culture
              from which the gene-expression measurements were taken. These
              active reactions are used to build environment-specific metabolic
              models and to predict actual metabolic states. We applied our
              method to model the metabolic states of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              growing in rich media supplemented with either glucose or ethanol
              as the main energy source. The resulting models comprise about
              50\% of the reactions in the original model, and predict
              environment-specific essential genes with high sensitivity. By
              minimizing the sum of fluxes while forcing our predicted active
              reactions to carry flux, we predicted the metabolic states of
              these yeast cultures that are in large agreement with what is
              known about yeast physiology. Most notably, our method predicts
              the Crabtree effect in yeast cells growing in excess glucose, a
              long-known phenomenon that could not have been predicted by
              traditional constraint-based modeling approaches. Our method is

              maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through
              different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects
              that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range
              of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP)
              and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based
              strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability
              that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as
              suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for
              growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate
              as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of
              flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental
              conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the
              impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout
              conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed
              that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant
              variation in growth rate if the flux variability among alternate
              optima is high. The underlying biological significance and
              general source of such flux variability is further investigated
              through the identification of redundancies in the network
              (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions.
              Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent
              in metabolic flux distributions and the possible implications of
              this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches.
              These methods also provide an efficient and robust method to
              calculate the range of flux distributions that can be derived
              from quantitative fermentation data.",

              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network
              structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of
              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many
              alternative network structures, all equally consistent with
              available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble.
              This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction
              methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance
              Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting
              growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be
              included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential
              genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential
              genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some

              the quality of predictions without drastically increasing
              reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical
              for applications which require predictions for many non-model

              metabolic model predictions",
  author   = "Robaina-Est{\'e}vez, Semid{\'a}n and Nikoloski, Zoran",
  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in
              reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally,
              our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into

              suggested to be a pathobiont, a commensal that plays a role in
              disease. In order to gain insights into its lifestyle, we
              analyzed the genome and transcriptome of M. schaedleri ASF 457
              and performed physiological experiments to test traits predicted
              by its genome. Although described as a mucus inhabitant, M.
              schaedleri has limited capacity for degrading host-derived
              mucosal glycans and other complex polysaccharides. Additionally,
              M. schaedleri reduces nitrate and expresses systems for
              scavenging oxygen and reactive oxygen species in vivo, which may
              account for its localization close to the mucosal tissue and
              expansion during inflammation. Also of note, M. schaedleri
              harbors a type VI secretion system and putative effector proteins
              and can modify gene expression in mucosal tissue, suggesting
              intimate interactions with its host and a possible role in
              inflammation. The M. schaedleri genome has been shaped by
              extensive horizontal gene transfer, primarily from intestinal
              Epsilon- and Deltaproteobacteria, indicating that horizontal gene
              transfer has played a key role in defining its niche in the gut
              ecosystem. IMPORTANCE Shifts in gut microbiota composition have
              been associated with intestinal inflammation, but it remains
              unclear whether inflammation-associated bacteria are commensal or
              detrimental to their host. Here, we studied the lifestyle of the
              gut bacterium Mucispirillum schaedleri, which is associated with
              inflammation in widely used mouse models. We found that M.
              schaedleri has specialized systems to handle oxidative stress
              during inflammation. Additionally, it expresses secretion systems
              and effector proteins and can modify the mucosal gene expression
              of its host. This suggests that M. schaedleri undergoes intimate
              interactions with its host and may play a role in inflammation.
              The insights presented here aid our understanding of how

  title    = "How accurate is automated gap filling of metabolic models?",
  author   = "Karp, Peter D and Weaver, Daniel and Latendresse, Mario",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Reaction gap filling is a computational technique for
              proposing the addition of reactions to genome-scale metabolic
              models to permit those models to run correctly. Gap filling
              completes what are otherwise incomplete models that lack fully
              connected metabolic networks. The models are incomplete because
              they are derived from annotated genomes in which not all enzymes
              have been identified. Here we compare the results of applying an
              automated likelihood-based gap filler within the Pathway Tools
              software with the results of manually gap filling the same
              metabolic model. Both gap-filling exercises were applied to the
              same genome-derived qualitative metabolic reconstruction for
              Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum JCM 1217, and to the same
              modeling conditions - anaerobic growth under four nutrients
              producing 53 biomass metabolites. RESULTS: The solution computed
              by the gap-filling program GenDev contained 12 reactions, but
              closer examination showed that solution was not minimal; two of
              the twelve reactions can be removed to yield a set of ten
              reactions that enable model growth. The manually curated solution
              contained 13 reactions, eight of which were shared with the
              12-reaction computed solution. Thus, GenDev achieved recall of
              61.5\% and precision of 66.6\%. These results suggest that
              although computational gap fillers are populating metabolic
              models with significant numbers of correct reactions,
              automatically gap-filled metabolic models also contain
              significant numbers of incorrect reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              conclusion is that manual curation of gap-filler results is
              needed to obtain high-accuracy models. Many of the differences
              between the manual and automatic solutions resulted from using
              expert biological knowledge to direct the choice of reactions

  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in
              reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally,
              our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into

              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We

              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

              increasing. So far the predictive capability of these methods has
              not been critically evaluated and compared. This work presents a
              survey of recently published methods that use transcript levels
              to try to improve metabolic flux predictions either by generating
              flux distributions or by creating context-specific models. A
              subset of these methods is then systematically evaluated using
              published data from three different case studies in E. coli and
              S. cerevisiae. The flux predictions made by different methods
              using transcriptomic data are compared against experimentally
              determined extracellular and intracellular fluxes (from
              13C-labeling data). The sensitivity of the results to
              method-specific parameters is also evaluated, as well as their
              robustness to noise in the data. The results show that none of
              the methods outperforms the others for all cases. Also, it is
              observed that for many conditions, the predictions obtained by
              simple flux balance analysis using growth maximization and
              parsimony criteria are as good or better than those obtained
              using methods that incorporate transcriptomic data. We further

  abstract = "The large size of metabolic networks entails an overwhelming
              multiplicity in the possible steady-state flux distributions that
              are compatible with stoichiometric constraints. This space of
              possibilities is largest in the frequent situation where the
              nutrients available to the cells are unknown. These two factors:
              network size and lack of knowledge of nutrient availability,
              challenge the identification of the actual metabolic state of
              living cells among the myriad possibilities. Here we address this
              challenge by developing a method that integrates gene-expression
              measurements with genome-scale models of metabolism as a means of
              inferring metabolic states. Our method explores the space of
              alternative flux distributions that maximize the agreement
              between gene expression and metabolic fluxes, and thereby
              identifies reactions that are likely to be active in the culture
              from which the gene-expression measurements were taken. These
              active reactions are used to build environment-specific metabolic
              models and to predict actual metabolic states. We applied our
              method to model the metabolic states of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              growing in rich media supplemented with either glucose or ethanol
              as the main energy source. The resulting models comprise about
              50\% of the reactions in the original model, and predict
              environment-specific essential genes with high sensitivity. By
              minimizing the sum of fluxes while forcing our predicted active
              reactions to carry flux, we predicted the metabolic states of
              these yeast cultures that are in large agreement with what is
              known about yeast physiology. Most notably, our method predicts
              the Crabtree effect in yeast cells growing in excess glucose, a
              long-known phenomenon that could not have been predicted by
              traditional constraint-based modeling approaches. Our method is

              now been constructed and are being used for model driven
              research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is
              the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same
              maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through
              different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects
              that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range
              of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP)
              and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based
              strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability
              that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as
              suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for
              growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate

              flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental
              conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the
              impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout
              conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed
              that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant

              optima is high. The underlying biological significance and

              through the identification of redundancies in the network
              (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions.

              open-label clinical trials. Objective: To determine the efficacy
              and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI. Design:
              Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.
              (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494). Setting: Two academic medical
              centers. Patients: 46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of
              CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most
              recent acute episode. Intervention: Fecal microbiota
              transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own
              stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy. Measurements: The
              primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for
              further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data
              were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse
              events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for
              6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on
              patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.
              Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients
              (90.9\%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared
              with 15 of 24 (62.5\%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042).
              Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6
              of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI
              after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent
              donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored
              gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble
              that of healthy donors. Limitation: The study included only
              patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those who
              were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older. Conclusion:
              Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more
              efficacious than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI

              repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that
              occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and
              interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network
              structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of
              GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the
              extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many
              automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time
              requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still
              require curation before useful predictions can be made. We
              present a novel approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves
              the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs by representing many
              alternative network structures, all equally consistent with
              available data, and generating predictions from this ensemble.
              This ensemble approach is compatible with many reconstruction
              methods. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance
              Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting
              growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be
              included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential
              genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential
              genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some
              metabolic subsystems contributed disproportionately to the set of
              predicted essential reactions in a way that was unique to each
              Streptococcus species, leading to species-specific outcomes from
              small molecule interactions. Through our analyses of P.
              aeruginosa and six Streptococci, we show that ensembles increase
              the quality of predictions without drastically increasing
              reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical
              for applications which require predictions for many non-model
              organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are

              of eight microorganisms that was developed by R.P. Orcutt and has
              been in use since the late 1970s. The eight microorganisms
              composing the ASF were all derived from mice, can be cultured in
              vitro, and are stably passed through multiple generations (at
              least 15 years or more by the authors) in gnotobiotic mice
              continually bred in isolator facilities. With the limitations
              associated with conventional, mono- or biassociated, and germfree
              mice, use of mice colonized with a consortium of known bacteria
              that naturally inhabit the murine gut offers a powerful system to

              The ASF community offers significant advantages to study
              homeostatic as well as disease-related interactions by taking
              advantage of a well-defined, limited community of microorganisms.
              For example, quantification and spatial distribution of

              not to the degree of a conventional complex microbiota.

              These services include the production of important resources,

              native to the gut microbiomes of honey bees ( Apis mellifera) and
              bumble bees (B ombus sp.). Expressing fluorescent proteins in
              Snodgrassella alvi, Gilliamella apicola, Bartonella apis, and

              colonize the bee gut. We also demonstrate CRISPRi repression in
              B. apis and use Cas9-facilitated knockout of an S. alvi adhesion

              metabolic model predictions",
  author   = "Robaina-Est{\'e}vez, Semid{\'a}n and Nikoloski, Zoran",
  abstract = "The integration of experimental data into genome-scale metabolic
              models can greatly improve flux predictions. This is achieved by
              restricting predictions to a more realistic context-specific
              domain, like a particular cell or tissue type. Several
              computational approaches to integrate data have been
              proposed-generally obtaining context-specific (sub)models or flux
              distributions. However, these approaches may lead to a multitude
              of equally valid but potentially different models or flux
              distributions, due to possible alternative optima in the
              underlying optimization problems. Although this issue introduces
              ambiguity in context-specific predictions, it has not been
              generally recognized, especially in the case of model
              reconstructions. In this study, we analyze the impact of
              alternative optima in four state-of-the-art context-specific data
              integration approaches, providing both flux distributions and/or
              metabolic models. To this end, we present three computational
              methods and apply them to two particular case studies:
              leaf-specific predictions from the integration of gene expression
              data in a metabolic model of Arabidopsis thaliana, and
              liver-specific reconstructions derived from a human model with
              various experimental data sources. The application of these
              methods allows us to obtain the following results: (i) we sample
              the space of alternative flux distributions in the leaf- and the
              liver-specific case and quantify the ambiguity of the
              predictions. In addition, we show how the inclusion of
              ℓ1-regularization during data integration reduces the ambiguity
              in both cases. (ii) We generate sets of alternative leaf- and
              liver-specific models that are optimal to each one of the
              evaluated model reconstruction approaches. We demonstrate that
              alternative models of the same context contain a marked fraction
              of disparate reactions. Further, we show that a careful balance
              between model sparsity and metabolic functionality helps in
              reducing the discrepancies between alternative models. Finally,
              our findings indicate that alternative optima must be taken into
              account for rendering the context-specific metabolic model
              predictions less ambiguous.",

              suggested to be a pathobiont, a commensal that plays a role in
              disease. In order to gain insights into its lifestyle, we
              analyzed the genome and transcriptome of M. schaedleri ASF 457
              and performed physiological experiments to test traits predicted
              by its genome. Although described as a mucus inhabitant, M.
              schaedleri has limited capacity for degrading host-derived
              mucosal glycans and other complex polysaccharides. Additionally,
              M. schaedleri reduces nitrate and expresses systems for
              scavenging oxygen and reactive oxygen species in vivo, which may
              account for its localization close to the mucosal tissue and
              expansion during inflammation. Also of note, M. schaedleri
              harbors a type VI secretion system and putative effector proteins
              and can modify gene expression in mucosal tissue, suggesting
              intimate interactions with its host and a possible role in
              inflammation. The M. schaedleri genome has been shaped by
              extensive horizontal gene transfer, primarily from intestinal
              Epsilon- and Deltaproteobacteria, indicating that horizontal gene
              transfer has played a key role in defining its niche in the gut
              ecosystem. IMPORTANCE Shifts in gut microbiota composition have
              been associated with intestinal inflammation, but it remains
              unclear whether inflammation-associated bacteria are commensal or
              detrimental to their host. Here, we studied the lifestyle of the
              gut bacterium Mucispirillum schaedleri, which is associated with
              inflammation in widely used mouse models. We found that M.
              schaedleri has specialized systems to handle oxidative stress
              during inflammation. Additionally, it expresses secretion systems
              and effector proteins and can modify the mucosal gene expression
              of its host. This suggests that M. schaedleri undergoes intimate
              interactions with its host and may play a role in inflammation.
              The insights presented here aid our understanding of how
